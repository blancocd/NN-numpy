# NN-numpy
A simple neural network framework in Numpy.

A multi-layer fully-connected neural network. The net has N inputs of size D, a hidden layer dimension of H, and output dimension C.  We train the network with a mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The network uses a ReLU nonlinearity after each FC layer but the last one. The outputs of the last fully-connected layer are passed through a ReLU.
